# PyUSB_FTC200
Control a Moxtek x-ray tube with an FTC-200 controller over a USB connection using python.

There is a library function that gives access to the FTC-200, and a standalone GUI allowing simple control of HV on-off and changing setpoints.

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS and on Mac OS 11 Big Sur. In both cases used Startech FTDI USB-serial converter.
